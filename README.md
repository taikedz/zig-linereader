# Zig LineReader

A Quality-Of-Life library to make common string accumulation operations easier for developers coming in from higher-abstraction languages.

Sometimes, you just want to work with "ASCII files at relative path-P" and "use strings."
This library provides an abstraction for this simple but common use-case.
